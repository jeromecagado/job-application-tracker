## üí° Why This Project?

As part of my journey in the **Microsoft Software & Systems Academy (MSSA)**, I‚Äôm building this project to:

- Apply backend development skills in Java
- Practice clean code and object-oriented programming
- Learn real-world tools like Git, Postman, and H2
- Showcase my ability to build and explain full-stack systems from scratch
- Prepare for software engineering interviews by implementing CRUD functionality and RESTful APIs

---

## üîú Roadmap

- [x] Implement CRUD endpoints (Spring Boot)
- [x] Test using Postman and H2 console
- [ ] Add job search via external API (Indeed, LinkedIn, etc.)
- [ ] Build frontend using React or React Native
- [ ] Deploy to cloud (Azure or AWS)

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup

To run locally:

```bash
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

Once running, access the API in your browser or Postman:

```
http://localhost:8080/api/jobs
```
