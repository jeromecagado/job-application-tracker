## üí° Why This Project?

As part of my journey in the **Microsoft Software & Systems Academy (MSSA)**, I‚Äôm building this project to:

- Practice clean code and object-oriented programming
- Learn real-world tools like Git, Postman, and H2
- Showcase my ability to build and explain full-stack systems from scratch
- Prepare for software engineering interviews by implementing CRUD functionality and RESTful APIs
